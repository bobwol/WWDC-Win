## OS Support

I only tested the app on Windows 10 build 10586, It should work with any Windows 10 build 10240 or later.

### Disclaimer

This is a "toy project", I am not a Windows developer and I've made this app just to see how It's like to create a modern Windows app. Feel free to send me pull requests.
